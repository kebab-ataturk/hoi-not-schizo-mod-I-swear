Notes:

[Su5.dds] is a current placeholder for both [GFX_portrait_ETH_military_communists] and [GFX_portrait_ETH_anarchist_council]. I was hoping to find an image of a bunch of Sus (doll with Medicine) or something akin to Medicine but a bunch of them for the group pictures, or maybe put a bunch of them together myself for them. Another option was making one of them the military commies while Shimmy could be the anarchist group. 

Unused folder contains images I made but didn't use in the end, feel free to delete or occupy them for more expressions/generals, leaders etc.
